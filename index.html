    <h1>hello,</h1>

    <p>I am Alex (<a href="https://twitter.com/blexchapman">@blexChapman</a>).

    <p>I graduated from CSU, Chico with a Bachelor's in Computer Science and a minor in Video Game Design.</p>

    <p>I enjoy making games, teaching, and making electronic music. Play my games over
      at <a href="https://blexchapman.itch.io">itch.io</a> (they're all free) and check out my various coding projects on 
      <a href="https://github.com/blexc">GitHub</a>. I also make <a href="https://youtube.com/channel/UCgC_8bWAuaf5VX99iFIITRg">
      random youtube videos</a>.</p>
      
    <p>Currently, I am working on Super Sushi Roll: a 2d marble game. Super Sushi Roll is widely considered to be one of the
      greatest games of all time, despite not being out yet. I stream the development of this game on
      <a href="https://twitch.tv/blex_c">twitch.tv</a> sporadically around 9pm PST.</p>
