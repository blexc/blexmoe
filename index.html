    <h1>hello,</h1>

    <p>I am Alex (<a href="https://twitter.com/blexchapman">@blexChapman</a>). I am a computer science student at CSU, Chico
      minoring in Video Game Design. I am graduating in December 2021.</p>

    <p>I enjoy making games, teaching, and making electronic music. Play my games over
      at <a href="https://blexchapman.itch.io">itch.io</a> (they're all free) and check out my various coding projects on 
      <a href="https://github.com/blexc">GitHub</a>. I also make <a href="https://youtube.com/channel/UCgC_8bWAuaf5VX99iFIITRg">
      random youtube videos</a>.</p>
      
    <p>Currently, I am seeking software engineering jobs, and working on my Senior Project - Super Sushi Roll: a 2d marble game.
      Super Sushi Roll is widely considered to be one of the greatest games of all time, despite not being out yet.
      In fact, Obama is a huge fan. I stream the development of this game on <a href="https://twitch.tv/blex_c">twitch.tv</a>
      sporadically around 9pm PST.</p>
    
    <p>If you know me and haven't already, add me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alextylerchapman/">LinkedIn</a>.</p>
